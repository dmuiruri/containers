## Instructions 

In this part, the frontend container is connected to the backend
container, allowing for the backend to service API calls from the
frontend application. The front end container is configured to access
the API resources provided by the backend. The backend is also
configured to allow the specific frontend client to access the API
resources.

These configurations are passed to the docker run command.

### Backend
Run the backend and bind the container's port 8000 to the host's port
8000 allowing for access the container through the
http://localhost:8000. The environment variable `FRONT_URL` allows the
backend to process Cross Origin Requests `(CORS)` from the localhost's
port 5000. When properly configured, the parameter
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin` can be observed to be set to
http://localhost:5000 from the network tab in the browser's developer
console.

`docker run -v $(pwd)/logs.txt:/App/logs.txt -d --rm -it --name sixthex -p 8000:8000 -e FRONT_URL="http://localhost:5000" nodesback`

### Frontend
Run the frontend at port 5000 and bind the containers port to the
host's port 5000. Set the environment variable API_URL that instructs
the container where access the resource.

`docker run -d --rm -it --name fifthex -p 5000:5000 -e API_URL="http://localhost:8000" nodes`
